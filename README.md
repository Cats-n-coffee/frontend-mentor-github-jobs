# Frontend Mentor Github Jobs Challenge

This challenge is from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
The Github Jobs Api is deprecated, therefore this solution will need refactoring and does not have a live version anymore. <br>
This project is bundled with Parcel and uses React and Styled Components (first time using them).

## Project structure

All components inside the corresponding folder are broken down into other folders by functionality or role on the page. Corresponding styles for each component are in the component file, in a separate file (if they are too long), or in the common styles. After using styles components for the first time and organizing styles this way, I would separate most of the styles to a different file to keep app logic and app styles in their own distinct files.

## After thoughts

After doing this project with plain React and no libraries, it was interesting and good exercise to implement page load/pagination. React Query would be a great tool to use in this challenge for loading more results, display spinners, results and errors.
